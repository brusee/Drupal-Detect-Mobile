# Drupal Detect Mobile

This is a lightweight custom Drupal module to detect mobile user agents and set a corresponding global variable which can be accessed from everywhere.

1. download zip
2. enable module
3. do stuff

After enabling the module you can simply request `if ($GLOBALS['is_mobile'] == TRUE)` for any mobile depending logic everywhere you want.

I'ld be happy about any enhancements. So, please fork!
